# 👕 RE-WEAR

**RE-WEAR** is a sustainable fashion platform developed for a hackathon. It encourages people to donate, exchange, and shop pre-owned clothes — reducing textile waste and promoting eco-friendly fashion choices.

## 💡 Inspiration

The fashion industry is one of the biggest contributors to environmental pollution. Our project **RE-WEAR** aims to solve this by promoting a circular fashion economy through easy donations, exchanges, and conscious shopping.
